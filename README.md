## Project Structure

The project is based on the 'Page Object Model' design pattern, where a class is created for each web page, containing its elements and locators, along with a Base class abstracting driver functionalities, and a class for each test to be executed, that are written in natural language.
In the image below, you can see the project structure:

* In Pages package, you'll find classes for each of the pages, including their locators and functionalities.
* In POM package, you'll find the Base class, where all WebDriver functionalities used by the pages are abstracted.
* In Test package, all the tests to be run are located, with each class representing a test.
* In Suite package, you'll find the TestSuite class, which is a class that groups all the tests and executes them sequentially, one after another.

### Running the project:

To run the project, select 'TestSuite' class and click on Run (green arrow button) on the top bar of the IDE. A Mozilla Firefox browser will open, and the tests will run sequentially one after another.

After finishing the tests execution, a new window will be open in the left-side of the IDE. It will show a detail of the tests executed, the total duration of it, and the execution results, showing whether a test passed, failed or had an error (see image below). In case a test resulted in a failure, you can see the detail of it on the 'Failure Trace' tab below, along with a trace to know where a validation failed.
